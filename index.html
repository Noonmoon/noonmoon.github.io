              <p>
                Best Of 3 was a final project created by me with the help of one other student. We decided to create a web application aimed at delivering a fun experience when settling debates or decisions with friends. In this project I took on the role of front-end developer and game/network programming. I was able to develop 3 different games and modes including real-time online multiplayer all in 3 weeks of development.  
                <br>
                <br>
                When developing this application the work was split up into front-end and back-end roles. My partner was responsible for user authentication, database and middleware. I was tasked with any front-end related development and programming including html & css, game development, web socket, design, and UI/UX. The user interface I developed ensured a user would never need more than 2 clicks to navigate where they desired.
                <br>
                <br>
                While developing this project one major problem I ran into was client state sychronization. Creating the socket network that would sync clients during play was a challenge I will never forget. Because I was creating my network with sockets this was an even greater challenge because there was no example of this in another application and my mentors had no prior knowledge of networking. Therefore it was recommended that I do not attempt the networking and just stick with local play. However, this was the basis of our project so I had to decided to keep trying all the way until I succeeded just 3 hours before our last day of mentor help. This moment was one that I will remember forever as I truly fell in love with the challenge development brings. For 5 days I was willing to keep my head down to create a piece of my projet that seemed out of reach 99% of the time.

              <p>Mocking Bird was my first personal project I decided to take on after bootcamp.
                Previous to this project I was intimidated by backend and devolopment and had never
                developed much without mentor help. Because of this I wanted an application that would
                require a lot of backend structure and thats what drove me to create a social network 
                from scratch. It took me about 1 week total to create the backend for the application 
                and I was able to take a lot away from those days.

                3rd Perspective Design was a family members business site I had decided to fully redesign
                and build in Wordpress. This was my first experience with freelancing, CMS, and free design.
                In the end they were very pleased with the site as it was a huge improvement from the last site.
                I learned a great deal about design and CMS in this project.

                Dare design is a side marketting business run by me and another family member.
                The site was originally designed and developed by a cheap freelancer and was very 
                poorly done. Within 1 day I was able to fix all problems with the site and even 
                add in new content, animations and features. I continued to redesign the site going 
                through 3 phases pictured below.
