              <h2>My role</h2>
              <p>
                In the development of this project we split our work into front-end and back-end focused roles. My partner was responsible for user authentication, database and middleware and I was tasked with any front-end related development and programming including html & css, game development, web socket, design, and UI/UX. The user interface I developed ensured a user would never need more than 2 clicks to navigate where they desired.
              </p>
              <h2>Challenges I faced</h2>
              <p>
                While developing this project one major problem I ran into was client state synchronization. Creating the socket network that would sync clients during play was a challenge I will never forget. Because I was creating my network with sockets this was an even greater challenge because there was no example of this in another P5 application and my mentors had no prior knowledge of client networking. Therefore it was recommended that I did not attempt this feature and stick with local play. However, this was the basis of our project so I had to decided to keep trying until I succeeded just 3 hours before our last day of mentor help. This moment was one that I will remember forever as the day I truly fell in love with the challenge development brings.

              <h2>In Summary</h2>
              <p>
                  Mocking Bird was my first personal project I decided to take on after boot camp.
                  Previous to this project I was intimidated by backend development and had never
                  taken on a role as such. Because of this I wanted an application that would
                  require a lot of backend power and thats what drove me to create a social network 
                  from scratch. 
              </p>
              <h2>Challenges I faced</h2>
              <p>
                Although challenging, I was able to create a working backend for my content using MySQL for the first time. I learned important details about the interactions between front-end and back-end elements as well as the full process of creating a backend application from scratch.

              <p>
                3rd Perspective Design was a family members business site I had decided to fully redesign
                and build in Wordpress. This was my first experience with freelancing, CMS, and free design.
                In the end they were very pleased with the site as it was a huge improvement from the last site.
                I learned a great deal about design and CMS in this project.

              <p>
                Dare design is a side marketing business run by me and another family member.
                The site was originally designed and developed by a cheap freelancer and was very 
                poorly done. Within 1 day I was able to fix all problems with the site and even 
                add in new content, animations and features. I continued to redesign the site going 
                through 3 phases pictured below.
